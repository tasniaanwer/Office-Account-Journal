- **Business Rules Engine**: Configurable business logic with execution logging

## SQLite Architecture & Optimization

### Database Configuration
```sql
-- Performance optimizations applied:
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;           -- Better concurrency
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;         -- Balanced performance/safety
PRAGMA cache_size = 10000;           -- Larger cache
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;          -- Temporary tables in memory
PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456;        -- Memory-mapped I/O (256MB)
```

### Index Strategy
1. **Primary Indexes**: All primary keys are text-based for UUID compatibility
2. **Composite Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
3. **Covering Indexes**: Reduce table lookups where possible
4. **Selective Indexes**: High-cardinality columns prioritized

### Connection Management
- **Single Connection**: Better-sqlite3 with connection pooling
- **Transaction Management**: Automatic transaction handling
- **Connection Timeout**: Configurable timeouts for long operations

### Using Enhanced Schema
```typescript
import { db, users, accounts, transactions, auditLog, accountBalanceCache } from '@/lib/db';

// Core functionality (unchanged)
const allUsers = await db.select().from(users);

// New performance features
const cachedBalances = await db.select().from(accountBalanceCache)
  .where(eq(accountBalanceCache.periodId, currentPeriodId));

// New security features
const auditTrail = await db.select().from(auditLog)
  .where(eq(auditLog.tableName, 'transactions'))
  .orderBy(desc(auditLog.timestamp))
  .limit(100);
```

### Adding New Business Rules
```typescript
import { businessRules, NewBusinessRule } from '@/lib/db';

const newRule: NewBusinessRule = {
  id: nanoid(),
  ruleName: 'large_transaction_approval',
  ruleType: 'approval',
  category: 'transaction',
  description: 'Require approval for transactions over $10,000',
  condition: JSON.stringify({ amount: { gt: 10000 } }),
  action: JSON.stringify({ requireApproval: true }),
  isActive: true,
  priority: 100,
  severity: 'warning',
  createdBy: currentUser.id,
};

await db.insert(businessRules).values(newRule);
```
